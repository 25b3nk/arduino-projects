# arduino-projects
My exploration of Arduino-based electronics projects.

## Projects

1. [Blink an LED via bluetooth](bluetooth/bt_blink/README.md)
1. [Range finder using ultrasonic sensor](ultrasonic/README.md)
1. [DIY tags](bluetooth/diy_tags/README.md)


## Future Projects
Here are some ideas for future projects that can be built using the components in the inventory:
*   **IoT Weather Station:** Use the ESP8266 WiFi module to connect to the internet, fetch weather data from a public API, and display it.
*   **IMU-based Gesture Controller:** Use the MPU6050 to detect gestures and control a computer mouse or a game.
*   **Wireless Sensor Node:** Use the HT-RX01 Radio module to build a wireless sensor node that can transmit data to a base station.
*   **Self-balancing Robot:** A more advanced project using the MPU6050. This would require additional components like motors and a motor driver.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you want to add a new project, please follow these guidelines:
1.  Create a new directory for your project in the appropriate category (e.g., `bluetooth`, `wifi`, `sensors`).
2.  Add a `README.md` file in your project's directory with a description of the project, required hardware and software, and instructions on how to build and run it.
3.  Add the Arduino sketch file (`.ino`) to the project's directory.
4.  Add a link to your project's `README.md` in the "Projects" section of this file.
